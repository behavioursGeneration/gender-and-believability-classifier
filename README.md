# gender-and-believability-classifier

## Gender classifier 
This classifier is used to determine whether the speaker's gender is easily identifiable in the non-verbal behaviors transmitted. 

## Believability
This classifier/discriminator of generated vs. real behavior is trained on a GAN-type model of non-verbal behavior generation. The discriminator parameters of this GAN are extracted and used here to discriminate the believability of behavior files. 

We get 1 if the classifier thinks the behavior comes from a real behavior and 0 if the classifier thinks the behavior comes from a generated behavior.

## How to use 
To run these files you would need to add three folders : 
* the data folder, which you can download here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1heVPZ9oSYOmdfOVytUsiWANnuKBLvljq?hl=fr
* the generated data folder: the csv files corresponding to the gaze, head movements and AUs generated by your models. Exemple here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KlytbvuCfaSSgD35Tlq4QDTQNCuNLXai?hl=fr
* the saved_models folder containing the trained classifiers, which you can download here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IfXOXlcB44t9sFjk0yZqFI9zJoUwZiYk?hl=fr
